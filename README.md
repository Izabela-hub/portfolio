# about me
For over 8 years I worked in a large company as a Business Specialist. I was responsible for developing incremental business opportunities with key accounts in computer hardware,  by selling innovative solutions of point of sale (POS) management systems and peripheral products. In 2021 I decided to consistently develop my career in manual testing. I found a passion for fixing bugs in code and programming. Working as a Software Tester, I want to deliver the quality assurance stage of software development. I'm carrying out manual tests to ensure the software created meets the requirements.
